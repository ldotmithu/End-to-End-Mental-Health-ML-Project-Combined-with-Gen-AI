# Mental Health Prediction and AI Response System

## 📌 Problem Statement
Mental health issues are increasingly prevalent, but early detection and intervention remain challenging. Traditional mental health assessments require professional evaluation, which may not be accessible to everyone. 

This project integrates **Machine Learning (ML) and Generative AI** to predict a user's mental health state based on their input and provide appropriate responses. If the predicted mental health level is low-risk, the system offers greetings or well-being messages. If needed, AI provides supportive advice based on the user's condition.

## 🚀 Features
- **Machine Learning model** to predict mental health status.
- **Generative AI** for personalized responses.
- Friendly greetings or supportive advice based on ML predictions.
- Scalable and adaptable for future improvements.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Pandas,Numpy
- **Generative AI:**  Groq (Mixtral model), LangChain, LLM
- **Frontend :** Streamlit

## 📥 Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ldotmithu/End-to-End-Mental-Health-ML-Project-Combined-with-Gen-AI
cd End-to-End-Mental-Health-ML-Project-Combined-with-Gen-AI
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔍 How It Works
1. User inputs text or answers a questionnaire.
2. ML model predicts mental health status.
3. Generative AI provides appropriate responses.
4. If the predicted level is low-risk, the system sends greetings; otherwise, it gives supportive advice.

---

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Enhance ML model accuracy with more data.
- Fine-tune Generative AI responses for better personalization.
- Add multiagent support.
